# üìö StudyBuddy ‚Äî Study Group Finder (Python Version)

## üß© Project Description
**StudyBuddy** is a lightweight web application that helps students create, join, and manage study groups for their classes.  
The app follows the **CRUD** model (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is built primarily with **Python (Flask)**.  
It allows users to add study groups, view existing ones, edit their details, and delete them when no longer needed.  

This project demonstrates the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** and applies **Agile** methodology in a small, two-person development team.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Apply the full SDLC (requirements, design, implementation, testing, and documentation).  
- Use **Python** for backend development and database management.  
- Build a small but complete full-stack app with Flask and SQLite.  
- Follow Agile methodology with short sprints and version control through GitHub.  
- Emphasize clean, simple, and modular code.
